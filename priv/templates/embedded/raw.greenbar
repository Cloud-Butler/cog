# This template is used explicitly when the 'raw' command is called. This allows
# us to render the entire json object, {"body": ["text"]}, for commands piped in
# that normally just render text.
# This is necessary for commands that return an object like {"body": ["list", "of", "strings"]}
# to prevent the fallback logic from rendering it with the text template.

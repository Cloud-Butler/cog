## Status 

Cog is currently in public alpha and is not currently recommended for mission
critical workflows. While many of the core features are in place, there are a
number of rough edges that we anticipate smoothing out over the next few
months. We are releasing it in this state in order to allow us to collaborate
in the open with the community in order to build the best possible platform.

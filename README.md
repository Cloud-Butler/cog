# Cog

Cog is an open chatops platform that gives you a secure, collaborative command line right in your chat window.

## Private Alpha

Thank you for participating in the private alpha test for Cog! Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/operable/cog/issues) to report problems, make feature requests, or to ask questions that don't need an immediate response.

While Cog is open source, we'd really appreciate it if you didn't share the code until we release it publicly.

All documentation is currently in the [Cog Wiki](https://github.com/operable/cog/wiki).
